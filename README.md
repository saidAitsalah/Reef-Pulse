# Reef-Pulse
This project applies artificial intelligence (AI) to the acoustic detection of marine species in coral reef ecosystems. By leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques for classification, the goal is to analyze underwater audio signals and identify key animal species of commercial or ecological interest.

# Objectives

    Develop a robust ML-based classification model to detect and identify marine species from underwater audio recordings.

    Provide valuable insights for marine conservation by assisting managers of French Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in monitoring biodiversity.

    Contribute to the development of sustainable management strategies for fragile marine ecosystems.

# Technologies

    Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, TorchAudio

    Signal Processing: Spectrogram transformation, feature extraction

    Dataset: Underwater hydrophone recordings

    Deployment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

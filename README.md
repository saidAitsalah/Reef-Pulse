# Reef-Pulse
This project applies artificial intelligence (AI) to the acoustic detection of marine species in coral reef ecosystems. By leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques for classification, the goal is to analyze underwater audio signals and identify key animal species of commercial or ecological interest.
